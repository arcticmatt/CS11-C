Terminology
What is a "Pinned Noti"?
A pinned noti is a notification that is fixed in the notification tray. You cannot delete it by swiping it or clicking clear all. The only way to delete it is to touch the notification, and delete it on the page it takes you to.
What is an "Expandable Noti"?
An expandable noti is a notification that can be expanded by pulling down on it with two fingers. All notis created by OmNotify are expandable.
What is a "Queued Noti" and a "Queued SMS"?
A queued noti is simply a notification that is scheduled to be made at a certain time, whether or not the phone is asleep. If Queue Reminders are turned on in the settings, a reminder will pop up at the specified queue time. Queues can either be one shot or repeating.

A queued SMS is the same thing, except instead of creating a noti, the phone will send an SMS at the time you specify.
